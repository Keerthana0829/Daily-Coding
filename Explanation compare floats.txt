The line 1 and 2 prompt the user to input two floating-point numbers, f1 and f2.
Both f1 and f2 are multiplied by 1000 to shift the decimal point three places to the right. 
This essentially retains the first three decimal places and then converts the resulting value to an integer.
Finally,by using if-else conditon the code compares the two integer values (n1 and n2), If they are equal, it prints "True" otherwise, it prints "False".
