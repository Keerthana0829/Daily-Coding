The line 1 defines a function named sum_of_natnum that takes one parameter n.
A variable called sum is initialized to 0. This variable will store the sum of natural numbers.
For loop iterates over a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at n.
For each number i in this range, the loop adds i to the current value of sum. 
Assigns the value 10 to the variable n. You can change this value to any other positive integer to calculate the sum
The line calls the sum_of_natnum function with the argument n and prints the result
